Rushing to the Town Square to investigate, you find your beloved Storyteller has been murdered… impaled on the hour hand of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. You assume that this is the work of a Demon, and you are correct - a Demon that kills by night and takes on human form by day.","intro_part03":"You are about to receive either a red or blue token. If blue, you are good. If red, you are evil. The aim of the game if you are good is to find and execute the Demon. If the Demon dies, good wins. The aim of the game if you are evil is to destroy the town. If just two players are left alive, evil wins.","intro_part04":"The game is split into two phases: a day phase and a night phase. During the day, you talk. You will each have a secret identity, a character on the list. Generally, the good players share whatever they know and attempt to find out who is who. Most good players will be telling the truth, but some have an incentive to lie. If you are evil, you should definitely be lying! It is best to pick a good character to pretend to be, spreading as much false information as possible.","intro_part05":"During the night, player cameras are hidden, and the Storyteller will wake some players so that they can use their ability or gain some type of information. When the Storyteller wakes you, a pop-up message will appear in the centre of the screen. Follow the instructions to communicate with the Storyteller in the pop-up window. During the night, if you need to access the pop-up window after responding to the Storyteller, click “Night info” in the upper right hand corner of the screen.","intro_part06":"If the Storyteller needs to privately discuss something with you, they may also request a voice chat. The chat request will appear on the left side of your screen. Click on it to join the chat. While in the chat, you can talk privately with the Storyteller. When you’re finished, press backspace or delete to return to the Town Square.","intro_part07":"Most of you will die. This is a good thing! In Ravenswood Bluff, death is not the end. Some players may even want to die, as they gain information when they do. If you are dead, you still participate in the game, you may still talk, and you still win or lose when your team wins or loses.","intro_part08":"There is a lot of information in this game. However, some of it might be wrong. If you are drunk or poisoned, you have no ability, but the Storyteller will pretend that you do. The Storyteller is allowed to lie to you - any information that you get may be incorrect, but you will not know if you are drunk or poisoned. For example, if you are the Drunk, you drew a different character token out of the bag and only the Storyteller knows that you are actually the Drunk. Or, if the Poisoner poisons you, you may still wake at night to use your ability, but it won’t work.","intro_part09":"This can be a lot of information to take in at once, so to keep things simple, there are only four things you need to remember:","intro_part10":"You may say whatever you want at any time.","intro_part11":"This is a talking game. You can talk publicly with the group or have private conversations, it is up to you.","intro_part12":"No peeking.","intro_part13":"Please play with integrity, and never use outside tools or help to access the Grimoire view, as it contains all the game characters. If you see something you shouldn’t, it will spoil the fun.","intro_part14":"Ask the Storyteller any questions you need to.","intro_part15":"If you get confused, or don’t understand how your character works, or don’t understand how the character that you are pretending to be works, or if something happens at night that you don’t understand, or you just need some strategy advice… whatever it is, please ask. The Storyteller is neutral, and their job is to help you understand the rules and have fun playing. Let them know when you have a question, and you can talk in private so that nobody knows what question you asked.","intro_part16":"Play nice.","intro_part17":"This is a game about deception and trickery, so please treat others with respect and consideration. Kill with grace, and die with dignity.","intro_part18":"Now it’s time for nominations.","intro_part19":"To nominate a player, simply say who. For example: “I nominate Bob.” When a player is nominated, everyone votes on whether or not to execute them. The Storyteller will announce that votes are starting, and the voting animation will appear on the screen. The voting clock hand moves in a clockwise direction, and you can use the Spacebar shortcut or the UP and DOWN buttons in the centre of the screen to raise or lower your hand. If your hand is up when the clock hand gets to you, that’s a vote, and if your hand is down, that’s not a vote.","intro_part20":"Each day, you may vote for as few or as many players as you wish, and whoever has the most votes is executed. This player needs a vote tally of at least 50% of the living players or no execution occurs. On a tie, neither player is executed.","intro_part21":"If you die, you are still a major part of the game. You still talk, and all player cameras are still hidden during the night phase. Most importantly, you still win or lose with your team. In fact, the game is usually decided by the votes and opinions of the dead players. When you die, you lose your character ability, you may no longer nominate, and you have only one vote for the rest of the game, so use it wisely."},"settings":{"background_placeholder":"URL to background image","background_text":"Please enter a custom background URL, or leave it blank to remove a custom background.","background_title":"Custom Background","button_always":"Always","button_login":"Social Logins","button_setup":"Run the Setup","button_verify":"Verify Account","css_apply":"Apply Custom CSS Rules?","css_confirm":"I know what I'm doing, let me change the look of my app","css_confirm2":"Please confirm that you want to keep the Custom CSS changes.
